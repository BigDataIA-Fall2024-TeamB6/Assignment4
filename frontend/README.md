## Getting Started

First install dependencies by running:
```bash
pnpm install
```

If `pnpm` is missing, install it via `npm`:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Create a `.env` from `.env.example` and add your API keys

Later, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
